## VALIDATION

 * [check-caro-fbbt](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-fbbt)
 * [check-caro-po](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-po)
 * [check-caro-xao](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-xao)
 * [check-caro-zfa](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-zfa)

Note the currently the fbbt check may be less complete, as Elk is used, due to fbbt being too large / too many axioms for HermiT

These are all grouped here: http://build.berkeleybop.org/view/Anatomy/

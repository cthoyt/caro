## VALIDATION

 * [check-caro-po](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-po)
 * [check-caro-zfa](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-zfa)
 * [check-caro-fbbt](http://build.berkeleybop.org/job/check-caro-fbbt)

Note the currently the fbbt check may be less complete, as Elk is used, due to fbbt being too large / too many axioms for HermiT
